    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Tailwind Stone & Slate) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard. The core is a clickable 30-day calendar grid, replacing the static table for intuitive navigation. A persistent side panel displays a strategic overview, including theme filters and a Chart.js donut chart showing content distribution. Clicking a day opens a detailed modal view with full copy and interactive elements. This structure was chosen because it transforms a linear report into a multi-dimensional analysis tool, allowing users to explore chronologically, thematically, and in detail, which vastly improves usability and strategic insight over a simple table. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: 30-day content plan for @assignmentprojectpro. Goal: To make the content strategy explorable and understandable.
    - Viz/Presentation 1: Interactive Calendar Grid (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Click to view details, hover for topic. Justification: Most intuitive way to visualize a monthly plan.
    - Viz/Presentation 2: Thematic Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Hover for details, legend toggles. Justification: Provides a high-level, data-driven summary of the content balance.
    - Viz/Presentation 3: Detail Modal (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: View full slide-by-slide copy, copy hashtags. Justification: Focuses user attention on a single day's content without losing context.
    - Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all logic and DOM manipulation, Chart.js for the chart. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
